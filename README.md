# UD-SoftwareProcessAndQuality
Repository were we will be uploading the project done for "Software process and quality" with the help of Diego Lopez de Ipina

This project will be a client server web service which will make the client able to see all his/hers budgets related to what ever they work on.

# What this project is about.
The project is about budgets that any user can create, and eventually, update, to finally visualizate some general statistics. These budgets can be customized as desired, with the records, that are created to introduce either the expenses or incomes in each budget.

# Running the application
You can run the whole application (frontend client, API and database included) using Docker with Docker Compose. To do this, move to the project root and run:
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```
To turn the system off, you can run:
```shell
docker-compose down -v
```
